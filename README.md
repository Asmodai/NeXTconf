# NeXTconf

NeXTconf is a system for configuring various files when building
software -- think of it as a mix of autotools, CMake, and your
favourite templating language (i.e Jinja.)

It is meant to be called early on by 'make' (or via script), and is
designed to help ease development when targetting multiple NeXT
platforms.

There will be more documentation here once the tool is nearer to alpha
quality.
